# C64UnifDiagCart

The original Dead Test Diagnostic Cartridge is designed to test
the C64 and C128/C128D, (C64 Mode), Systems that fail
to display video information on Power Up even with the
C64 or C128/C128D Diagnostic Assembly installed.

The Dead Test is meant only as an extra troubleshooting
tool to assist the Technician in repairing Dead PCBs and
does not replace the current C64 or C128/C128D Diagnostic
Assemblies now being used.

The Dead Test is almost completely dedicated to System RAM
testing and does no type of System ROM or Port Testing.
